<h1>League Gothic</h1>

<p>League Gothic is a revival of an old classic, and one of our favorite typefaces, Alternate Gothic #1. It was originally designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Fuller_Benton">Morris Fuller Benton</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders">American Type Founders Company</a> in 1903. The company went bankrupt in 1993, and since the original typeface was created before 1923, the typeface is in the public domain.</p>

<p>We decided to make our own version, and contribute it to the Open Source Type Movement. Thanks to a commission from the fine &amp; patient folks over at <a href="http://wnd.com">WND.com</a>, itâ€™s been revised &amp; updated with contributions from Micah Rich, Tyler Finck, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dannci">Dannci</a>, who contributed extra glyphs.</p>
